					<div class= "col-sm-12">
						<p class="text-light">Rajasthan- the land of Royals, the state is known for its royal culture and customs. Amidst this glorious culture and heritage, there is a story: Story of a child born in this land,into social norms of the society,  a child who’s denied an education.An education that empowers them to dream without fear. We at Sashkatikaran work towards providing this education to so many children in Rajasthan through transformational teachers.</p>
					<h3 class="section-sub-heading">Our Vision:</h3>
						<p class="text-light" >“All children in Rajasthan will get an education that empowers.”
						<br/>
						We strongly believe, education will empower our children to make a well informed choice in their
						life. It will empower them to do what their heart speaks. It will empower them to speak up without
						any fear or inhibition. It will empower them to analyze themselves and become better human
						beings.</p>
					<h3 class="section-sub-heading">Our Mission:</h3>
						<p class="text-light" >“Our mission is to create transformational schools through transformational teachers.”
						<br/>
						We will ensure that students avail the best of education by developing our capacity in teachers. Teachers are greatly invested in their students to facilitate learning, provided they receive support and motivation. If teachers understand the importance of the work they do, and are valued for their efforts, can transform their student’s life. In turn, our teachers will have developed and assumed their roles as mentors, leaders and innovators. We recruit dedicated teachers from our very own city, to be trained over a period of a month. Our teachers will be inducted to be placed in schools we interact and support for an year.  </p>

                	<p class="text-projects">The year 2017 is marked by our association with our very first school in Jaipur, Geeta Ashram. Geeta Ashram has so graciously granted us to work with the students in their primary section to enhance and facilitate learning. Our goal is to provide students with an encouraging school and classroom culture, providing 175 students with six trained teachers to support them in their journey of becoming a mentor and a leader.
Geeta Ashram tasks under a trust by the name Raghukul Shiksha Samiti. Located in Sodala Area, Geeta Ashram has educated children in the area for the past 15 years. Today, the school has enrolled students from Nursery to Grade 7. Majority students in the school commute from Sushil Pura and Ashok Pura Kachi Basti, localities near Sodala Area in Jaipur. In this community, children seeking education are first generation learners, most of their parents work as drivers or street vendors.
Our belief is that every child deserves an education that empower him/ her; irrespective of their socio-economic background. With this in mind, we have envisioned our mission at Geeta Ashram. Through highly motivated and committed teachers, and innovative teaching-learning interventions; we aim to make the process of learning joyful, as well as, impactful.
